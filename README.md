# Customer-Segmentation-

Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals that are similar in specific ways relevant to marketing, such as age, gender, interests and spending habits.

What are the primary segments for Chemicorp's customer base given the data we have? What are the unique characteristics of each segment? Which segment(s) is the most attractive (in terms of profitability and market opportunity)? Are there any products that the company should discontinue? These are some of the questions that Chemicorpâ€™s management team is grappling with, and this is my attempt to answer the questions help Business make effective decisions.
